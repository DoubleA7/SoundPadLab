  <div>
  <p>The SoundPad Lab uses 3D audio to create assistive technology, universally accessible interfaces, multi-modal interfaces, and to discover patterns in big data. We also research the perceptual requirements necessary to render realistic spatial sound using headphones in virtual environments. </p>

  <p>Our research interests include Human Computer Interaction in the contexts of 3D Audio Processing, Multi-modal Interfaces, Psycho-acoustics, and Virtual Environments.</p>
